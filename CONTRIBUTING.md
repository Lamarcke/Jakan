Welcome! Thank you for your interest.

## Installation

Make sure you have `Node` and `npm` installed.

First, let's make sure you have the entire project in your environment. Clone it:  
`git clone https://github.com/Lamarcke/Jakan.git`

And then:  
`npm install`

That's it! You are ready.

## What you need to keep in mind

Our Typescript + ESLint configs are very rigid. Please make sure to never use `any` unless necessary (like in catch blocks).
It's also important to documment your new code/changes in the docstrings to make sure `TypeDoc` adds then correctly.

You can use tools like `Mintlify` for this. Just make sure the results make sense.

Don't be afraid to file a issue againsn't this repo if you are having any problems or doubts. We are happy to help.
